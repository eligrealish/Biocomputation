Genetic algorithms are a class of computation algorithm that represent problem spaces as a population. Through the use of mathemtical operators select, crossover and mutate they solve problems in faster time then traditional search methods.


## How does this project use genetic algorithms?

This project uses genetic algorithms to optimise functions 1 and 2. Optimisation is an important part of data science and genetic algorithms are good at optimising of functions for problems involved in operation management, multimedia and wireless networking.
